### Cumulative distribution function (CDF)
To be a distribution function, the function needs to satisfy:
- Monotone increasing
- Bounded

(1)$F(x)^{r}$
Monotone: easily we know F(x) is monotone, and so we assume that $F(x)^{k}$ is monotone increasing. For $F(x)^{k+1}$, for all $ x, y\in R$, $x\leq y$ we define a function $G(x, y)=F(x)^{k+1}-F(x)^{k}$, and by calculating its gradient we can know only when $F(x)^{k}=F(y)^{k}=0$, it reaches its minimum 0.
Therefore, $F(x)^{r}$ is monotone increasing.

Bounded: $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} F_X(x) = 0 \text{ and } \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} F_X(x) = 1$
So $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} F_X(x)^{r} = 0^{r}=0$, $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} F_X(x)^{r} = 1^r=1$

Therefore, $F(x)^{r}$ is a distribution function.

(2)$1-(1-F(x))^r$
Monotone: easily we know $1-F(x)$ is monotone decreasing, and by (1) we can infer that $(1-F(x))^r$ is monotone decreasing, so $1-(1-F(x))^r$ is monotone increasing.

Bounded: $\lim\limits_{x \to -\infty} 1-(1-F(x))^r = 0$, $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty} 1-(1-F(x))^r = 1$
