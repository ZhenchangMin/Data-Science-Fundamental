## Problem 1 Moments and (co)variances
### Run
#### 1
Denote number of runs by $R_n$
For $n$ tosses, we can think of $n−1$ opportunities for a "**switch**" to occur between heads and tails. The total number of runs will be 1 (the first toss) plus the number of switches between heads and tails.
The probability of a switch occurring between the $i$th and $i+1$th tosses is $p(1-p)+(1-p)p=2p(1-p)$, so the expectation:
$$
E(R_n) = 1+(n-1)\times 2p(1-p)
$$

As for the variance, the number of runs can be thought of as the sum of indicator variables for whether a switch occurs between each pair of consecutive tosses.
Each switch is a **Bernoulli trial,** where the probability of success (a switch) is $2p(1−p)$. 
The variance is therefore derived from the **binomial distribution**, where the total number of trials is $n−1$, and the probability of success (a switch) is $2p(1−p)$
$$
Var(R_n)=(n-1)\times 2p(1-p)\times(1-2p(1-p))
$$

#### 2
The expected number of runs of heads is given by the number of times we expect a transition from tails to heads in the random arrangement. This is roughly the number of times a tail precedes a head, and can be approximated by:
$$
E(\text{runs of heads})=\frac{h}{n}
$$
On average, each head will start a run in a random sequence.

And the variance can be computed as:
$$
Var(\text{runs of heads})=\frac{h(1-p)}{n}
$$

#### 1 Possible values of $G$ and corresponding probabilities
1. If head comes on the first flip
Then $G=x$ and he stops, probability is $\frac{1}{2}$
2. If tails comes on the first flip, and heads comes on the second flip:
$G=-x+y$, and he stops, with the probability of $\frac{1}{4}$
3. If tails comes on the first flip, tails on the second flip, and heads on the third flip:
$G=-x-y+z$, with the probability of $\frac{1}{8}$
4. If tails comes on all three flips:
$G=-(x+y+z)$, with the probability of $\frac{1}{8}$

#### 2 Expectation and Variance of $G$
$$
E(G)=x\times$\frac{1}{2}$+(-x+y)\times$\frac{1}{4}$+(-x-y+z)\times$\frac{1}{8}$-(x+y+z)\times$\frac{1}{8}$=0
$$
$$
Var(G)=E(G^2)-(E(G))^2=E(G^2)=x^2+\frac{2y^2+z^2}{4}
$$

$$
Pr(G<0)=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}=\frac{1}{2}
$$

#### 3 Vary the Order
We should put the relative smaller ones before the bigger ones, so z for first bet, y for second, and x for the third.
In this way, with probability $\frac{1}{4}$ we get G=y-z which is positive, and with some probability \$frac{1}{8}$ G=x-y-z might be positive, so in this way we minimize $Pr(G<0)$
and $Var(G)$

### Moments
$$
E(X^{\alpha})=\sum_{x=1}^{\alpha}x^{\alpha}f(x)
$$
Substituting $f(x)=\frac{1}{x(x+1)}$
$$
E(X^{\alpha})=\sum_{x=1}^{\alpha}x^{\alpha}f(x)=\sum_{x=1}^{\alpha}\frac{x^{\alpha}}{x(x+1)}
$$

For large x, the series is dominated by $x^{\alpha-2}$
So the series $\sum_{x=1}^{\alpha}x^{\alpha-2}$ coverages if $\alpha-2<-1$
Therefore $\alpha < 1$

### Covariance and correlation (i)
Firstly, prove $|ρ|=1 \Rightarrow X=aY+b$
Now that X and Y are perfectly linear related, $Cov(X, Y)=±\sigma_X\sigma_Y$
Thus $X=aY+b$ for some constants a and b.

Then, prove $ X=aY+b \Rightarrow |ρ|=1$
Then
$$
Cov(X, Y)=Cov(aY+b, Y)=a\times \sigma_Y^2
$$
Therefore
$$
ρ=\frac{Cov(X, Y)}{\sigma_X\sigma_Y}=\frac{a\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}
$$
Since $X=aY+b$, |ρ|=1
